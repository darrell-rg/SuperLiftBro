 Microsoft kinect to influx via processing.

This is a personal project to record and compare body position (form) during olympic style weightlifting.  
The plan is to use influx to store joint xyz, joint angles, foot pressure, etc.   I record lifts from skilled weightlifters and then the novice user can compare his form to the pros.   I want to make the user interface game-like so that learning correct form is fun.

The advantage of using influx is that I can combine time series data from multiple sensors.
